        The framework system Bootstrap and a design template from Bootstrap were
        used. You can get Bootstrap here: 
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank"
          >https://getbootstrap.com/</a
        >
      </p>

        We wrote HTML and JavaScript. We also used Nunchucks with Eleventy to
        generate HTML for the header and footer and to create all of the recipe
        pages from markdown files. We customized CSS styles taken from the open
        source Bootstrap library.

        All images are from Pexels. We had used AI-generated images and recipes for the regional conference.  The state conference READ READ READ states that AI is not allowed, so we deleted all the AI on our website.
