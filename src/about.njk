        The framework system Bootstrap and a design template from Bootstrap were
        used. You can get Bootstrap here: 
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank"
          >https://getbootstrap.com/</a
        >
      </p>

        We wrote HTML and JavaScript. We also used Nunchucks with Eleventy to
        generate HTML for the header and footer and to create all of the recipe
        pages from markdown files. We customized CSS styles taken from the open
        source Bootstrap library.

        All images were from Pexels. We had used AI-generated images and recipes for the regional conference.  Before 4/14/2025 we only had six recipes that were not generated by AI.
        We found out on 4/14/2025 on the state conference READ READ READ document that we couldn't use AI anymore. We deleted all the AI and ended up with only six recipes.
        We had intended to replace the Pexels photos with our own photos of the recipes, but we never got to doing that.
