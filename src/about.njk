        This website was built by Lucius White, Aaryan Pasupula, and Jayma
        Westlake, all 7th graders in Boyertown Middle School East TSA.

        The framework system Bootstrap and a design template from Bootstrap were
        used. You can get Bootstrap here: :
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank"
          >https://getbootstrap.com/</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        We wrote HTML and JavaScript. We also used Nunchucks with Eleventy to
        generate HTML for the header and footer and to create all of the recipe
        pages from markdown files. We customized CSS styles taken from the open
        source Bootstrap library.
      </p>

      <p>
        All images were generated using ChatGPT. We intend to replace with real
        photos of the recipes as we make them.

        website is hosted on Github Pages. There are instructions to do this on
        Github. (Look for “Pages.”)
